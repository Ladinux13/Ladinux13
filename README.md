  Data Analyst | Geospatial Scientist | Python | Machine Learning <br>
</p>


I'm a specialist in **Geospatial Information Sciences**, with a background and experience in advanced solutions using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and open-source geospatial tools.

Currently, I work at Mexicoâ€™s **Tax Administration Service (SAT)** as a Data Analyst, where I lead the migration of processes to Python, automation of workflows, and the development of interactive dashboards and spatial risk models for institutional analysis.

I'm passionate about using **data science**, **interactive visualizations**, and **automation** to turn raw data into actionable insights that improve decision-making in public institutions.
